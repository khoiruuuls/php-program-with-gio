PHP installed in OS 

- Manual Installation 
- Manual Database Installation 
- Manual Configuration 

XAMPP / MAMP / WAMP

- All in One Solution 
- Contains Web Server
- Contains Databases 
- Precofigured

Virtual Machines / Docker 
- Better alternative ( covered in separate video )

Soo, we are going to using XAMPP because of 

- No multiple PHP versions
- No multiple MySQL versions
